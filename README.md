# What is AntiBackdoor
AntiBackdoor is a tool which helps you remove the Minecraft Trolling/Griefing plugin "Backdoor" from your server.

## How to use AntiBackdoor
Specify the location of your server jar file and plugins folder with the start arguments `-serverJar` and `-plugins`, then run the program. It will then scan your server jar file and all plugins in the plugin folder and give you the option to delete / disinfect infected files.
